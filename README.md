# uno-r4-distance-visualizer
A simple Arduino Uno R4 project that reads distance from an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and visualizes it on the built-in 8x12 LED matrix.

**Components Required:**
  1) Arduino UNO R4
  2) Jumper wires
  3) Breadboard (Optional)
  4) HC-SR04 Module

**Cicuit Diagram:** (Note that the diagram uses an arduino uno R3 but an uno r4 is needed for the built in LED Matrix)

**Project Demo:**
A piece of paper was added to the top of the matrix to improve visibility.
